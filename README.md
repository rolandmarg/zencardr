## Zencardr

Match pairs correctly, on medium difficulty you have to match three cards. Deployed on http://cardr.vercel.app/

UI feels very raw and minimal, if I spend more time on this project, first thing I will add is animations on **Victory** popup and card reveals

App is responsive, should render nicely for any screen

```yarn dev``` in development

```yarn start && yarn build``` in production

```yarn test``` to run tests
